# addNode(value)
Called on a Tree object: add a node to the tree. It requires a value, and is sorted relative to other nodes in the tree.

# traverse()
Called on a Tree object: returns an array consisting of every node in the tree in numeric order.

# search(value)
Called on a Tree object: searches the tree for a node with the value specified - returns an existing node, or null.
